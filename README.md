# rouTracer

Welcome to rouTracer, a clone of the social media fitness app Strava. It was made over the course of several weeks in October 2018. Check it out [here](https://routracer.herokuapp.com/)!

## Front End
rouTracer's front end is implemented with React, Redux, Recharts (a graphing API), several Google APIs (Maps, Directions, Elevation), and React-Search-Input (search bar), with Webpack as a Bundler.

## Back End
rouTracer's back end is built with Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, AJAX, and JBuilder (a DSL that provides syntax for structuring JSON responses)
